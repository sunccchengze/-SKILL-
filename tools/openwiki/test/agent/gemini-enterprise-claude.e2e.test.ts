// End-to-end regression for issue #3, using the REAL Anthropic Vertex SDK (no
// mock) and the REAL Mermaid DOM shim. The optional Mermaid validation path
// installs jsdom's window/document globals process-wide; the Anthropic SDK's
// browser guard (window && window.document && navigator all defined) then throws
// "browser-like environment" at client construction, aborting the whole run.
//
// This test would FAIL (throw that error) if dangerouslyAllowBrowser were
// removed from the AnthropicVertex construction. Unlike the mocked unit test it
// exercises the actual SDK guard, so it guards against a base-SDK option rename
// or a regression in the fix.
//
// Suppressing the ADC unhandled rejection: AnthropicVertex's constructor eagerly
// runs `new GoogleAuth().getClient()` and does not await the promise (it is only
// awaited later, on the first request). In an unauthenticated CI environment that
// promise rejects with "Could not load the default credentials" AFTER this test
// resolves, so Vitest reports an unhandled rejection and fails the run even
// though every test passes. Mocking google-auth-library does not help here:
// @anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk is externalized CommonJS, so its internal
// `require("google-auth-library")` never routes through Vitest's mock registry.
// Instead we point GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS at a throwaway `authorized_user`
// credentials file so the eager lookup resolves offline: those creds build a
// UserRefreshClient with no network call, and this test never triggers a token
// refresh. The real GoogleAuth still runs, keeping the test genuinely end-to-end.
