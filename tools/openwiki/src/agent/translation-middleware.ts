 * the agent only rewrites pages whose source changed. This `beforeAgent` hook
 * closes that gap. It is mounted on every `update` and does one of three things,

 * on a plain update it retranslates just the pages a prior run left marked
 * `openwiki_translation_pending`; on a real language switch it retranslates every
 * page.
 *
 * The model's output is treated purely as file text and written back through the
 * sandboxed docs-only backend; it is never executed, and every path comes from
 * backend enumeration rather than model output.
 *
 * A single page's translation failure never aborts the run: the page is left in
 * its previous language, stamped with a pending marker so the next update retries
 * it, and reported through `onWarning`. `onWarning` defaults to writing the
 * (already secret-redacted) summary to stderr.
 *
 * The raw translated Markdown is kept out of the token stream (see
 * {@link NOSTREAM_TAG}); `onStatus` is called once instead, with a short line
 * announcing the pass, so the user sees progress without the flood of tokens. It
 * fires only when at least one page is actually translated, so a no-op marker
 * sweep stays silent, and defaults to writing the line to stderr.

Leave the "tags" values in English so they stay stable across pages as cross-cutting aggregation keys. Keep every front matter key as written, and copy all other values (URLs, file paths, identifiers, timestamps) byte-for-byte.
- Do NOT translate code identifiers, file paths, commands, API names, URLs, or anything inside inline code spans or fenced code blocks.
- Preserve all Markdown syntax, link targets, mermaid fences, and the document's whitespace and structure.
